# Part B - Interest Analysis
## 1. Which interests have been present in all month_year dates in our dataset?
#### SQL Query
````sql

````
#### Final Output

## 2. Using this same total_months measure - calculate the cumulative percentage of all records starting at 14 months - which total_months value passes the 90% cumulative percentage value?
#### SQL Query
````sql

````
#### Final Output

## 3. If we were to remove all interest_id values which are lower than the total_months value we found in the previous question - how many total data points would we be removing?
#### SQL Query
````sql

````
#### Final Output

## 4. Does this decision make sense to remove these data points from a business perspective? Use an example where there are all 14 months present to a removed interest example for your arguments - think about what it means to have less months present from a segment perspective.
#### SQL Query
````sql

````
#### Final Output

## 5. After removing these interests - how many unique interests are there for each month?
#### SQL Query
````sql

````
#### Final Output
